# pe-bo-demo
Source for Platform Events and Big Objects Demo. Use case is external order fulfilment system (not included) that sends updates on shipping and other fulfilment activities to Salesforce via a platform event. When the platform event after insert trigger executes the event data is captured in a big objects record.

For setup of this source, you will need to give access to the objects and other included resources to your users. Use the included Lightning Custom Order Page as the record home page for users or apps of your choosing.

This source is provided free of charge and no support is promised. I'm happy to entertain any issues or merge requests from interested parties.
